# Motion-Tracking

This assignment investigates human motion tracking during walking using tri-dimensional acceleration data obtained via a smartphone.
The main goal is to analyze the movement patterns of the user and use them to predict the location of the phone on the body. Specifically, the task focuses on classifying the phone position among four possible locations:

  - Left hand
  - Right hand
  - Left trouser pocket
  - Right trouser pocket

Unlike most of the Master’s projects, this is an end-to-end machine learning project, as it covers all stages of a typical data-driven pipeline.
This includes data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training and evaluation, visualization of results, and the reporting of insights. 
By following the complete workflow, the project provides a comprehensive view of how raw sensor data can be transformed into actionable predictions.
